## Setup
1. Install Docker
2. Run `docker/start.sh`. This will build the Docker container for this project, run, and exec into it. The build will take a long time if it it is your first time running this, as the CUDA base image is very large.

## Game Plan

- [ ] Docker environment setup (terrance)
- [ ] Setup Gym and Tractor environment
- [ ] Define neural network model
- [ ] Define RL algorithm (e.g. DQN, PPO, etc.)
- [ ] Train :))
